# Core application framework
fastapi
uvicorn
gunicorn # For production web server

# Model inference
ultralytics # For YOLOv8
# ultralytics might pull in torch/torchvision or you might need to add it explicitly
# If you are using CPU-only:
torch==2.7.1+cpu # Specify CPU version to avoid CUDA dependencies, reducing image size
# If you need a specific torchvision for CPU:
torchvision==0.22.1+cpu
# If you need CUDA, then it's a different base image or complex setup
numpy # Often a dependency of torch/ultralytics

# # Data handling and utilities often pulled in by FastAPI/ultralytics
# pydantic
# pydantic_core
# starlette
# anyio
# sniffio
# h11
# orjson # if you use orjson for faster JSON serialization
# pillow # Pillow (PIL Fork) for image processing
